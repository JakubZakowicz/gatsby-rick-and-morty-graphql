# Rick and Morty Website made in Gatsby
This is a Rick and Morty website made in Gatsby. In this website you can find information about each character, episode and location from one of the most popular and beloved (by me included) TV shows "Rick and Morty". Data is fetched from GraphQL API https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql.

## React version

Here is a remake of React version of this website https://github.com/JakubZakowicz/react-rick-and-morty-graphql. The main difference between Gatsby and React version is that in Gatsby the whole website is statically generated, where in React data is dynamically fetched. Thanks to Gatsby static site generator the website is faster and more efficient comparing to its React version.

I made this website to hone my skills using Gatsby and get to know new gatsby plugins.

## What have I learned?
My understending of Gatsby and GraphQL has improved. Additionaly I learned how to statically generate data from external API and got to know new plugin and funcionalities.
